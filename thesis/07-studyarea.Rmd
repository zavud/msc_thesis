The area of the national park is about 10,000 hectare [@fischer2016scientific]. There are various forestry activities (selective cutting etc.) occuring in the national park area. The forest is mainly dominated by the plant species Norway spruce (*Picea abies*), oak (*Quercus petraea*) and beech (*Fagus sylvatica*) [@buddenbaum2015nationalpark].
