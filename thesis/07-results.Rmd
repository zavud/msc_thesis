## Local sensitivity analysis

Figure \@ref(fig:fsens) shows the result of sensitivity analysis. Chlorophyll content ($C_{ab}$) appears to almost exclusively impact the visible spectra. Some effect can also be noticed in the red-edge, but there is not a significant effect of varying $C_{ab}$ on the simulated spectra within the near-infrared (NIR) and short wave infrared (SWIR) (Figure \@ref(fig:fsens).a). Conversely, equivalent water thickness ($C_{w}$) (Figure \@ref(fig:fsens).b) and leaf dry matter content ($C_{m}$) (Figure \@ref(fig:fsens).c) both have large effects on simulated spectra within the NIR and SWIR but no significant effect within the visible spectra. Leaf Area Index (single) ($LAI_{s}$) (Figure \@ref(fig:fsens).d), Crown diameter ($CD$) (Figure \@ref(fig:fsens).e)) and Stem density (Figure \@ref(fig:fsens).f) all have noticeable effect on the simulated canopy reflectance almost all over the spectra.

## RTM simulation (INFORM)

Synthetic canopy reflectance data set were produced and stored in a LUT containing all 316,800 simulations. In this research, LUT was defined as a matrix. Each row of this matrix is a different simulated spectra and columns are simulated reflectance of wavelengths with the range of 400nm-2500nm with 1nm spectral resolution and 6 additional columns containing values of the corresponding variables $C_{ab}$, $C_{w}$, $C_{m}$, $LAI_{s}$, $CD$ and $SD$ that were used for each simulation. Hence the dimensions of the LUT matrix is 316,800 rows (number of simulations) by 2107 columns (2101 simulated "bands" + 6 INFORM variables):

\begin{bmatrix}
400nm_{1} & \dots & 2500nm_{1} & Cab_{1} & Cw_{1} & Cm_{1} & LAIs_{1} & CD_{1} & SD_{1}\\
400nm_{2} & \dots & 2500nm_{2} & Cab_{2} & Cw_{2} & Cm_{2} & LAIs_{2} & CD_{2} & SD_{2}\\
\ \vdots  &\ \vdots &\ \vdots &\ \vdots &\ \vdots &\ \vdots &\ \vdots &\ \vdots &\ \vdots\\
400nm_{316,800} & \dots & 2500nm_{316,800} & Cab_{316,800} & Cw_{316,800} & Cm_{316,800} & LAIs_{316,800} & CD_{316,800} & SD_{316,800}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

In this matrix, $400nm_{n}$, $\dots$, $2500nm_{n}$ refer to the simulated reflectance for the corresponding wavelength in the simulation number $n$. $Cab_{n}$, $Cw_{n}$, $Cm_{n}$, $LAIs_{n}$, $CD_{n}$ and $SD_{n}$ are values of the INFORM parameters that were used in the $n$th simulation.

## Spectral resampling

The output of INFORM simulations were resampled to 231 PRISMA bands. The LUT matrix was used for spectral resampling and the resulting matrix has a dimension of 316,800 rows (number of simulations) by 237 columns (231 PRISMA image bands + 6 INFORM variables):

Band1_{2} & \dots & Band231_{2} & Cab_{2} & Cw_{2} & Cm_{2} & LAIs_{2} & CD_{2} & SD_{2}\\
\ \vdots  &\ \vdots &\ \vdots &\ \vdots &\ \vdots &\ \vdots &\ \vdots &\ \vdots &\ \vdots\\

\end{bmatrix}

In this matrix, $Band1_{n}$, $\dots$, $Band231_{n}$ correspond to the simulated reflectance for the corresponding image band in the simulation number $n$. $Cab_{n}$, $Cw_{n}$, $Cm_{n}$, $LAIs_{n}$, $CD_{n}$ and $SD_{n}$ refer to the values of the INFORM parameters that were used in the $n$th simulation.
