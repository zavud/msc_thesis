# Satellite Data

In this study, the hyperspectral satellite data PRISMA (PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa) was utilized. The PRISMA sensor has Field of View (FOV) of $2.45^{\circ}$ and swath of 30 km. The sensor takes images within the spectral range of 400-2500nm. The PRISMA image has 66 bands in the visible and near infrared (VNIR) region (400-1010nm) and 173 bands within the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region (920-2505nm) of the spectrum. The spectral resolution of the data is somewhere between 6nm and 12nm. The hyperspectral data has a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 30 m [@candela2016prisma; @giardino2020first; @verrelst2021mapping]. The scientific fields that are expected to largely benefit from the PRISMA data are mainly environmental, climate change and forest research areas, among others [@giardino2020first].
