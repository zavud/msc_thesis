\section{Local sensitivity analysis}\label{local-sensitivity-analysis}}

Local sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of each of the main 6 plant biochemical and biophysical variables on the PRISMA image bands. In the local sensitivity analysis simulation is performed by keeping all the variables constant at their determined fixed or default values except the parameter of interest. This way the effect of a specific parameter on the simulated spectra can be assessed. In this research the plant parameters \(C_{ab}\), \(C_{w}\), \(C_{m}\), \(LAI_{s}\), \(CD\) and \(SD\) were varied each 15 times (Table (\ref{tab:tsvaried})), while keeping the rest of the variables at their default values (Table (\ref{tab:tsfixed})). The default and varied values were chosen based on the literature (e.g. \citet{darvishzadeh2019mapping}; \citet{laurent2011inversion}; \citet{schlerf2012vegetation}) where similar RTM method used to simulate reflectance for Spruce trees.

Table \ref{tab:tsvaried} shows the 6 parameters that were varied, their units, minimum and maximum values. Each parameter was varied 15 times, meaning 15 different spectra were simulated for each variable.

\emph{Solar zenith angle} and \emph{Sun-sensor azimuth angle} were calculated based on the PRISMA image acquisition parameters (date, lat/long etc.) using the \emph{solar position calculator} at \url{https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/azel.html}.

RTM models PROSPECT5, 4SAIL and FLIM were coupled (INFORM) in order to simulate canopy reflectance. Simulations were carried out using the \emph{ccrtm} package \citep{ccrtm} in \emph{R} \citep{r}. The default soil spectra provided by the the \emph{ccrtm} package \citep{ccrtm} was used for the simulations. Spectral resampling was performed in order to resample the INFORM output spectra (1nm resolution) into PRISMA image bands. For spectral resampling the \emph{R} package \emph{hsdar} \citep{hsdar} was utilized.

\section{RTM simulation (INFORM)}\label{rtm-simulation-inform}}

PROSPECT5, 4SAIL and FLIM RTM models were coupled (INFORM) to simulate forest canopy reflectance based on different values of plant biophysical and biochemical parameters. The 6 parameters that were mentioned in the previous chapter were varied and spectra was simulated based on each combination of these variables. The number of combinations increase exponentially, which in turn requires increased computational power. Therefore, the trade-off must be taken into account between computational power or time and accurate simulation.

Different authors suggest different number of LUT size for RTM simulation. For example, \citet{danner2021efficient} mention that LUT size of minimum 50,000 is recommended. \citet{ali2020machine} and \citet{darvishzadeh2019mapping} created a LUT size of 100,000 and 500,000 respectively.

In this research, LUT size of 316,800 was created based on each combination of different plant biophysical and biochemical parameters. The range of the varied parameters and parameters that were kept constant were determined based on the suggestions of the studies that were mentioned in the previous chapter. These studies used similar methods to simulate canopy reflectance for mainly Spruce forests/trees.

Table \ref{tab:tinformfull} shows the variables that were used to simulate forest canopy parameters. Table \ref{tab:tinformfull} also contains information about the range of the values and how many times each parameter was varied.

All simulations were performed using the library \emph{ccrtm} \citep{ccrtm} in \emph{R} programming language \citep{r} using the most recent version 4.1.0. Generating a LUT size of 316,800 is an expensive process from a computational standpoint (depending on how much computer resources and time are available this might change). Also, all simulations are independent of each other, meaning simulation of one spectra has no effect on the other, as every simulated spectra is simulated based on a different combination of parameters. These two factors make the generation of such a large LUT good candidate for parallel computation. Therefore, the software packages \emph{doParallel} \citep{doparallel} and \emph{foreach} \citep{foreach} were utilized for parallel computation (using all the available cores) in \emph{R} programming language \citep{r}. This significantly reduced the computational time. All of the simulations were computed on a Lenovo Thinkpad E480 running under Windows 10 operating system with a processor Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz, 2001 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 8 logical processor(s).

\hypertarget{spectral-resampling}{%
\section{Spectral resampling}\label{spectral-resampling}}

The output of INFORM simulations have 1nm spectral resolution within the range of 400nm-2500nm and needs to be spectrally resampled to PRISMA image bands. In this research, the spectral response function of the PRISMA image was used. Band center wavelengths and full width half maximum values were extracted from the PRISMA image metadata and used for spectral resampling. For spectral resampling, the \emph{R} package \emph{hsdar} \citep{hsdar} was utilized.

Figure \ref{fig:fsens} shows the result of sensitivity analysis. Chlorophyll content (\(C_{ab}\)) appears to almost exclusively impact the visible spectra. Some effect can also be noticed in the red-edge, but there is not a significant effect of varying \(C_{ab}\) on the simulated spectra within the near-infrared (NIR) and short wave infrared (SWIR) (Figure \ref{fig:fsens}.a). Conversely, equivalent water thickness (\(C_{w}\)) (Figure \ref{fig:fsens}.b) and leaf dry matter content (\(C_{m}\)) (Figure \ref{fig:fsens}.c) both have large effects on simulated spectra within the NIR and SWIR but no significant effect within the visible spectra. Leaf Area Index (single) (\(LAI_{s}\)) (Figure \ref{fig:fsens}.d), Crown diameter (\(CD\)) (Figure \ref{fig:fsens}.e)) and Stem density (Figure \ref{fig:fsens}.f) all have noticeable effect on the simulated canopy reflectance almost all over the spectra.

\section{RTM simulation (INFORM)}\label{rtm-simulation-inform-1}}

Synthetic canopy reflectance data set were produced and stored in a LUT containing all 316,800 simulations. In this research, LUT was defined as a matrix. Each row of this matrix is a different simulated spectra and columns are simulated reflectance of wavelengths with the range of 400nm-2500nm with 1nm spectral resolution and 6 additional columns containing values of the corresponding variables \(C_{ab}\), \(C_{w}\), \(C_{m}\), \(LAI_{s}\), \(CD\) and \(SD\) that were used for each simulation. Hence the dimensions of the LUT matrix is 316,800 rows (number of simulations) by 2107 columns (2101 simulated ``bands'' + 6 INFORM variables):
