# Important notes from literature

1. The paper Danner et al. 2021 explains (page 2 - left side) the challenges of training ML methods on data collected with in-situ methods.

2. The paper Danner et al. 2021 explains (page 2 - right side) mentiones about more accurate 3D models and their drawbacks

3. Darvishzadeh et al. (2008b) proposed an average absolute error threshold value (≤ 0.02) between simulated spectra and measured (Sentinel-2) spectra to identify well-simulated bands.

4. Imaging spectroscopy data include correlated and
sometimes noisy bands which create statistical problems, also known as
curse of dimensionality (CoD) or the Hughes phenomenon (Bellman
et al., 1957; Keogh and Mueen, 2017). One of the problems that may
arise with the CoD are collinearity effects when apparently independent
predictors (bands) are correlated.

6. Five hundred thousand (500,000) sets were then generated randomly using uniform distributions for the other model input parameters, as proposed
by le Maire et al. (2008)
